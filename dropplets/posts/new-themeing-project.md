 Ok I am really excited about this new project I have begun. I think it could potentially be worth some value to the cloudesphere. So sit back and grab some coffe as I will be breaking down as I go along socheck back often. While I delve into the inerworkings of my creativty on this one.

##The Project

Simple but its a theme for a popular web application. I wanted to find something that would require alot of attention to detail on the design aspect. but mainly focus on the rapid prototyping of a large scale theme utilizing modern frameworks, conventions.

The end state is to establish a worklow for my self since its been a long time since I have done anything major.


####What I want out of this
- Workflow
- Improve my use of sublime text to utilize more of its resources and plugins inorder to sprred up my workflow
- Wrap my mind around working with a CSS framework.
- Establish some insight into the responsive/mobile first design process for my self


####The Leverage
To accomplish this project I am going to be ading alot of new things to my arsenal of Webary.

*	[Stylus][4]
*	[nib][5]
*	[JEET][6]

*	[GiT][12]

*	[Bootstrap 3.0][11]


####The TODO
*	Design Creation
*	XHTML Prototyping

*	Elemitimizing
*	JHancing
*	Some Assembly Required
*	Benching
*	Deployment!


##The Design Stage
For the design of the app I choose to to take a different approach then I have ever before. 

Rather than Designing a lyaout I wanted to focus on the individual elements that make up the the style for the theme. To accomplish this is a concept or product refered to as a styleguide.

The stylegide allowed me to do two unique things that are new and exciting for me.


##### 1. Focus on elements spacing 
This is something I have never done before. I mean I have heard of __mobile__ first, but until know I do not really think I understood it. Usually I am think about spacing and the design of something and this tends to slow down the **creativity**. I get stuck trying to make something fit into the place rather than blend. By focusing on the elements and not where they belong I open my mind to think about different things. If I get stuck I can always work on another element or retweak something that needed a second look.

This gives me the ability to polish things down the road and mock them up as it were farily quickly. Well that and the improvemetns to photoshop since CS4, did I forget to mention I join the new Creative Cloud so I was able to aquire the latest version of photoshop which is let me tell you way easier to work with when mocking up template designs. I know Stay on Target!


##### 2. Keep everything on one canvas. 
No pages. At least not yet. Since their will need to be one for the backend version of the theme.

This is also quite usefull as it allows me to compare design descisions across eemtents from multiple pages. This leades to more consistancy as well as Less work in the CSS as well. It also plays into the polish piece and everything else I mentioned from above.


####Progress Report
I am nearing the final stages of the Mock-up just a few more minor elements to through in and  will have a completed StyleGuide. Stay tuned for more to come.
