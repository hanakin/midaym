The web is changing, more and more we need to provide content that spans different devices at different resolutions. In this feature I will introduce you first hand to the world of responsive design & development from mobile first. Follow along as I redesign a popular web application theme to introduce it to different mediums. Learn the concept of a workflow and start implementing one for yourself

### In the Begining
we need to determine a few things before we begin. 

-	what are the breaking points that we need to hit
-	what are the elements that are required to be shown on a mobile decive
-	what elements can we bring to the tablet to enhance its experience
-	whats left for the desktop
- in a world of really large screens to heack with 960! what can we improve for widescreens

### Style the Guidelines
*	First establish a simple 3-5 swatch color scheme and block out color wells on the canvas for easy use.
*	Should allow for the design of individual elements in relation to varying width restrains, regaurdless of location & outer spacing
*	Should be a single page to include all required elements.
*	Should be a standardize document to implement into your workflow

### The Weapons
This is just a quick overview of the tools that I will be using throughout this series, so that you can get a feel for my workflow.
We also need to define what libraries, dependencies, or frameworks are required for our project.

### Rapid Prototyping
Straight to the code. Pure html setting up the semantic structure of the individual elements and applying them to base layout that we established in the first step

### The Flavour
Here we esablish our elements as css objects

### Tweak & Polish
This is where we merge the HTML with our css objects and make things act the way we want structurally.

### Seperation Anxiety
Now we breakout the content into repeatable segments/blocks of html

### Template Temptation
Now we apply our template ariables to the HTML

### Add the JS
Here we create all the JS enhancements for the theme as well as add in all the data attributes to the html

### Bench
Render and test the them for performance as well as feel, to fix any issues

### Deploy
FIN!
