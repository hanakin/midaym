		<h3>Design Brief</h3>
		<p>
		The first step is for the client, in that I provide a detailed set of questions for you as the client to answer that will better help me to establish the exact direction you are looking to go 	with your site. Questions such as who is the competition in your companies field? Give me a brief history of your company? These are samples of some of the questions in the design brief, the more detailed the brief the better the results.

		<h3>Brain Storm</h3>
		<p>
		This step consists of a series of smaller steps. I start by reading over the design brief, and collecting images and reference material from anywhere and everywhere that I feel playing around to rough out the different elements that will make up the overall design. Afterwards I have what is called a Rough. There can be several concepts or roughs. I narrow these down to begin the design process.

		<h3>Design</h3>
		<p>
		This is where I begin to layout the first Mock-ups of the site I say mock-ups because these require final approval by you the client before we go on to code it. Therefore it can go through a few revisions.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="span-7 push-1 last">
		<h3>Put to Code</h3>
		<p>
		After we finalize our design I code it for the web. I start by breaking the design up into its individual elements and rebuild it for the web. 
		</p>

		<h3>Spice it then Clean it.</h3>
		<p>
		Once i have the structure of the site coded I move on to adding dynamic effects and animation to make it more user friendly. After which I go through all the code and optimize it for readability, faster page loads, and search engines
		</p>

		<h3>The Banckend</h3>
		<p>
		The last part of the process is not for everyone but is highly recommended. I take the newly developed site and integrate it into a custom installation of wordpress content management software to give you complete control over the content on your website.
