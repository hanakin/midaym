Merry Christmas all ... I relize it has been awhile since I have posted anything, no news or updates in several months. Know that I have not been neglecting the site or my projects. I have been hard at work on some very interesting and exciting endevours. Well it being the holidays in all I figured I would give everyone a little gift. No its not the new computer you all wanted, or a finished project. Instead I wanted to give everyone a big update on whats to come in the very near future.

## What have I been upto you ask?
Their have been two competing projects on my docket for sometime now. One being Mino the new forward thinkging and truely responsive theme for a popular web application. If you have not guessed as of yet to what application I will let you in on the anticipation. It will be a new theme for the PHPBB web forum software.

The second project that was taking up my time is the reinventing of the site. I started to move to a whole new approach to my site several months ago and why its exactly along the lines of what I wanted I have been looking into putting together my own unique system to deliver just that.

Both of these are very large projects. The second require vastly more effort on my part as it requires php work as well and the fact that I wish to use the new Laravel framework to build it which has a learning curve for me.

The one thing that I had been noticing while working on Mino and begining the inital stages of reworking the site theme as well to fit to the smae front-end framework as Mino, was that it just was not going to work.

The custom framework I had thrown together for Mino in my last post was working just fine for an application so far, but just did not quite work for a standalone site theme. Infact the more I worked on Mino the more I realized I just did not have the framework I wanted.

This is what I set out to do. I needed to take a step back and analize the framework. I wnated something extremely extensible that I could yuse for all of my projects. Something that was so modular yet so dynamic that I did not have to included unneccesary bloat in all my projects.

I also wanted something that was extremely organized and did more than just provide me with a flat stale file to apply to my prject akin to most frameworks. Instead I wanted to be abe to customize the way I applied the front-end layer each and everytime I have a project to each and every page if need be.

When working on Mino their are essentially completely different and unigue pages that you would need so why include all the code across all of them when you could have a custom layer for each situation.

Lastly after reading some interesting articles about modularity I stumbled upon a concept know at Atomic Design which simply put leverages the small changes we make on the layout of elemetns on a page should infact be applied to the page instead of in the css. What I mean by this is instead of adding a property in our class to center align text or float it left we inturn create a single class to float content left or align the text to the center and apply this to the indivual HTML elemetns that require. This reduces the CSS file and the ammount of changes we need to make to it as time progresses since we can always swap a center text class in the HTML for a left text class without ever having to modify the stylesheet.

## Where I am at
I have been hard at work putting alot into the development of this framework and wanted it to be more than just something that I use for my projcts. I want to put it out their for others to use and to comment on so that we can all grow and improve what we do.

I am near the end of its development and it is coming together nicely. Since I plan on releasing this publicly I do have to spend a little time putting together the presentation of the framework which is mainly where I am at now. Hopefully this does ot take too much longer.

In the meantime here is a small example of what is to come in this framework. I have updated the themes color scheme to utilize just some of the custom colorscheme that I have put together for this framework.

Enjoy!!!
