Extra! Extra! see whats hot of the factory floor. Here it is the new and improved look for midaym.com. I have made several changes through out the site. including the addition of an archives page. for a full list of whats new and the details read the full right up.

## The Round up
Firstly everything is new. This is a completely new them with a completely new front-end framework powering it thats right this is the first early use case for the new frame work I have been working on aptly named "Surgar3" (Sugar cubed).

I have made several changes to the backend as well streamlining the code to make it easier on my eyes slightly. Allowing easier manipulation for the additon of a new section in that of the archives section.

I also add a new section to the posts page to allow for the sharing of my articles among several social sharing sites.
 
I also made some subtle styalistic changes to the layout and theme including an brand new icon set. Thts not all with the new framework being a mobile first approach take a look at the site on all your devices to see all the variations of the theme in a new light.

The last major change to the site is the introduction of a new server running the site. I have migrated over to a virtual cloud based serve giving me complete control over the server from the backend to install anything I need on it and plenty of apce to install other projects as well. So sorry for the downtime but this was not an easy transition and I am sure their are still some bugs in the system.

This is all something I have been shooting for since late oct.. So I hope you all enjoy the changes to the site and whats to come keep an eye out for content coming at you know!
