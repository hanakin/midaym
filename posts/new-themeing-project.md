 Ok I am really excited about this new project I have begun. I think it could potentially be worth some value to the cloudesphere. So sit back and grab some coffe as I will be breaking this down as I go along socheck back often. While I delve into the inerworkings of my creativty on this one.

##The Project<small>[Project Mino]</small>

Simple but its a theme for a popular web application. Which you may ask, well I don't want to say just yet you will have to tune in to find out. 

I wanted to find something that would require alot of attention to detail on the design aspect, but mainly focus on the rapid prototyping of a large scale theme utilizing modern frameworks and conventions.

The end state is to establish a worklow for my self since its been a long time since I have done anything major.

####What I want out of this
- Workflow
- Improve my use of sublime text to utilize more of its resources and plugins inorder to speed up my workflow
- Wrap my mind around working with a CSS framework possibly.
- Establish some insight into the responsive/mobile first design process for my self


#### The Weapons
To accomplish this project I am going to be ading alot of new things to my arsenal of Webary.

*	[HTML5 & CSS3][1] - Not new just new to the app
*	[HTML5Boilerplate][8] - Not and not fully being used here
*	[Normalize.css][3] - Not really adding but its their
*	[SMACSS][5] - We need some sense of order to a project like this
*	[LESS][4] - I am a less user so this is what I will be using.
