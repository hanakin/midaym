The web is changing, more and more we need to provide content that spans different devices at different resolutions. In this thats why with this project I will be devloping &amp; applying responsive design & development from mobile first. Follow along as I redesign a popular web application theme to introduce it to different mediums.

##The Design Stage
For the design of the app I choose to to take a different approach then I have ever before. 

Rather than Designing a layout I wanted to focus on the individual elements that make up the the style for the theme in order to simplify and objectify the various parts of the app. To accomplish this I used a concept or product refered to as a styleguide.

The styleguide allowed me to do two unique things that are new and exciting for me.


##### 1. Focus on elements spacing 
This is something I have never done before. I mean I have heard of **Mobile** first, but until know I do not really think I understood it. Usually I am thinking about spacing and the design of something and this tends to slow down the **Creativity**. I would find myself getting stuck trying to make something fit into the place rather than blend with the orveral look & feel of a design. By focusing on the elements and not where they belong I open my mind to think about different things. If I get stuck I can always work on another element or retweak something that needed a second look.

This gives me the ability to polish things down the road and mock them up as it were farily quickly. Well that and the improvemetns to photoshop since CS4, did I forget to mention that I recently joined the new Creative Cloud from Adobe, so I was able to aquire the latest version of all their apps which has let me tell you made things way easier to work with when mocking up template designs. I know Stay on Target!

##### 2. Keep everything on one canvas. 
**No pages.** At least not yet. Since their will need to be possible a second theme for the backend version of the app. I may need a second style guide. I have not decided weather I want to merge the two.

This is also quite usefull as it allows me to compare design descisions across elemtents from multiple pages. This leads to more consistancy as well as Less work in the CSS as well as makes the content more modular. It also plays into the polish piece and everything else I mentioned from above.

####Progress Report
I am nearing the final stages of the Mock-up just a few more minor elements to through in and I will have a completed StyleGuide. Stay tuned for more to come.
