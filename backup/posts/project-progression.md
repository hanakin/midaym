With the holiday season winding down and my time-off coming to and end. I have made my resolution to be more organized and productive. With things at work not doubt picking up after the long break and staying that way for the next couple of months. To meet my resolution I need to come forth with a few details related to the projects I am working on.

## The project list
I have three projects in various stages of development. I order to better organize and tackle these projects I need to first establish what each of them are and set some soft deadlines.

### 1. CSS Framework <small>[https://github.com/hanakin/sugar3](https://github.com/hanakin/sugar3)</small>
This is the closest to being completed. I am going to be setting a deadline of May 1st that should give me ample time given my workload to finish and implement a usecase within the Mino project

### 2. Mino PHPBB Theme <small>[https://github.com/hanakin/mino](https://github.com/hanakin/mino)</small>
This is going going to require a reboot of the current code base to utilize the new CSS Framework I have been working on. Since it is reliant on this I have a start date of April. This should give me a soft deadline of September hopefully. For at least the frontside theme. However the scope for this is to include an admin theme based on the new framework to match.

### 3. New Markdown Laravel Blog <small>[https://github.com/hanakin/MarkO](https://github.com/hanakin/MarkO)</small>
This is still in the research stage and has not had any code written for it. However it is intended to be a simple flat DB markdown blog somewhat akin to the Dropplets approach but utilizing a JSON based DB scheme to store all the settings and header information for all the posts.

## Call to arms
With my time being taken up with work in order to meet some of these deadlines I would like to reach out to anyone willing to assist with these projects. I order to facilitate this I am going to work on getting everything marked up for each project on GitHub. I will update this with links to all the repos once they are all available. In the meantime if interested in helping on any of these projects let me know by shooting me a msg on GitHub [@hanakin](https://www.github.com/hanakin).
